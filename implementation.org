#+TITLE: Implementation
We will implement a small prototype which will be a JavaScript API using which
a developer can embed different tools in the frontend code to generate desired
UX for user with disabilities.
* Requirements
** For Voice I/O (for type C users, type F users)
    - API for text to speech synthsis
    - API for voice recognition
** For type D users
    - Multicolor options on CSS files
** All output sounds to visual test display (For type A users)
    - API for speech(capture sounds generated by software) to text conversion.
** For performing user Accessibility test
    - create a small demo like test for starting a an app in accessibility
      mode, which will ask user to give voice input or
      choose an option. This will ensure the type of user.
* Technical specs
** Prototype development sprints classified according to I/O type
  | I/O type     | milestone                        |
  |--------------+----------------------------------|
  | Voice output | page reader                      |
  |              | developer controlled page reader |
  | Voice input  | textarea writer                  |
  |              | form filler                      |
  | Voice I/O    | form filler                      |
  |              | page navigation                  |
  |              |                                  |

** Implementation 
| module | functions         |
|--------+-------------------|
| speak  | speak(text)       |
|        | iterateSpeakSeq() |
|        |                   |

| listen |   |
|        |   |
*** Page Reader
Input: text
output: voice
We need to choose a voice by default and create an utterance which speaks
specified input only
