#+TITLE: An Adaptive Web Framework for Users with Disabilities
#+DATE: 15 September, 2017

* Background
- While walking through the website [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/][BBC]] there was an option for
  people with disabilities which said "I am blind" means asking the user if
  he/she is blind.
- Majority of website are difficult to access for such people.
- Applications like screen reader also lack in user friendliness in reading a
  website.

* Problem
- Most of the web accessibility projects leave the responsibility of
  accessibility on the end user which means that they endorse/recommend different web UI
  structures which an accessibility tool like native screen reader can read
  efficiently and care less about end user experience.
- But in an ideal case if a user is blind and he alone is trying to explore the
  web, he should not require intervention of someone else, everytime he/she visits a new
  webpage or goes online.
- User with disabilities should also get an semantic experience as enriching as normal
  users do.
** TODO
- There are accessibility guidelines by the W3C to make a website accessible
  for differently abled.
- Other ways in which a blind user can access a website.

* Abstractions - Accessibility problem related to webpages
** Structured I/O guidance for a disabled user on user side is not available.
*** Presently, Webpage accessibility depends on the user side inbuilt tools.
     - Page is structured in a way that those tools read it more
       efficiently. But the user is dependent on these tools which come packed
       with the OS and require to be called explicitly.
     - For example, if it's a screen reader, it will only ready the full page
       from top to bottom instead of just reading the region of interest that
       also in a structured guided path.
     - Inbuilt accessibility tools provide one way interaction only. That means they are not smart
       and interactive.

** Proposed tools
      - Tools which can interact with user. Can take input as well as provide
        output all in one  interface.
      - May not need to be installed on machine, comes packed with the webpage itself.
      - Requires less interruption from user's side.
      - Help user in guiding through the webpage.
** Different type of disabilities and potential solutions:
      | Type | Disability                                        | required Solution                                            |
      |------+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
      | A    | Deafness                                          | Convert all sound outputs to visual outputs                  |
      | B    | Dumbness                                          | Convert all voice inputs to typable input fields             |
      | C    | Complete Blindness                                | Voice I/O Assistance while navigating through a website.     |
      | D    | Color Blindness                                   | Multicolor stylesheets                                       |
      | E    | Partial Blindness                                 | Variable text size.                                          |
      | F    | Physical disability - no hand(s)/improper hand(s) | Voice Input Assistance while navigating through the website. |
      | G    | None                                              | None                                                         |
* Why solving the accessibility challenges is important in smart cities?
- Smart cities will be more dependent on technology
- More technology means more smart devices which means more users interacting with
  diverse range of UI designs and content.
- Making sure that every application is accessible to all. Means UI should be disabled friendly too.
- Ensuring the standard quality of interface experience on end user side in
  case of disabled user.
- Standardizing the UX for disabled users.
* Proposed Solution
- We propose a framework to embed multi-linguistic abilities in the webpage itself.
- Like /css mediaqueries/ which allows a webpage style to self-arrange
  according to the screen size, we propose a framework for making a page
  self-arrange according to the disability of the user. Different set of
  instructions or paths can be embedded by the developer in the app itself to
  ensure the desired UX for disabled users.
- On the other side, a browser must have an option which let the user set his own
  accessibility preferences.
